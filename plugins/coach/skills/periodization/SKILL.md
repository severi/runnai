# Periodization & Training Plan Design

## Training Phases

### Base Phase (4-8 weeks)
- **Focus**: Aerobic development, injury prevention
- **Volume**: Build gradually to target weekly mileage
- **Intensity**: 80-90% easy, 10-20% moderate (strides, tempo introductions)
- **Progression**: Increase weekly volume by 10% per week, with recovery week every 3-4 weeks
- **Key workouts**: Easy runs, long runs (building distance), strides 2x/week

### Build Phase (4-8 weeks)
- **Focus**: Lactate threshold, running economy
- **Volume**: Maintain or slightly increase base mileage
- **Intensity**: 75-80% easy, 20-25% quality (tempo, intervals, hills)
- **Key workouts**: Tempo runs (20-40 min at threshold), cruise intervals, progression runs
- **Quality sessions**: 2 per week maximum, never back-to-back

### Peak/Specific Phase (3-6 weeks)
- **Focus**: Race-specific fitness, pace familiarity
- **Volume**: Maintain or slight decrease (90-95% of peak)
- **Intensity**: Race-pace work becomes primary quality session
- **Marathon-specific**: Goal pace runs (8-16km at marathon pace within long run)
- **5K/10K-specific**: VO2max intervals, race-pace repetitions

### Taper Phase
- **5K/10K**: 7-10 days, reduce volume 30-40%, maintain some intensity
- **Half Marathon**: 10-14 days, reduce volume 40-50%
- **Marathon**: 2-3 weeks, reduce volume 50-60% final week
- **Ultra**: 2-3 weeks, similar to marathon
- **Rule**: Reduce volume NOT intensity. Keep short sharp sessions.

### Recovery Phase (post-race)
- **5K/10K**: 3-5 days easy, back to normal in 1-2 weeks
- **Half Marathon**: 5-7 days easy, 2-3 weeks to resume quality
- **Marathon**: 2-4 weeks easy running only, no quality for 3-4 weeks
- **Ultra**: 3-6 weeks progressive return, listen to body

## Mesocycle Design

### Standard Pattern: 3+1 or 2+1
- **3+1**: 3 weeks progressive build + 1 recovery week
- **2+1**: 2 weeks build + 1 recovery week (better for injury-prone or older athletes)
- Recovery week: reduce volume 20-30%, maintain 1 quality session at lower volume

### Weekly Structure Templates

**3-4 runs/week (beginner/time-limited)**
- Mon: Rest
- Tue: Easy run
- Wed: Rest or cross-train
- Thu: Quality session (tempo/intervals)
- Fri: Rest
- Sat: Easy run
- Sun: Long run

**5-6 runs/week (intermediate)**
- Mon: Rest or easy recovery
- Tue: Quality #1 (tempo/threshold)
- Wed: Easy run
- Thu: Easy run with strides
- Fri: Quality #2 (intervals/hills)
- Sat: Easy run
- Sun: Long run

**6-7 runs/week (advanced)**
- Mon: Recovery run
- Tue: Quality #1 (AM: intervals, PM: easy)
- Wed: Easy run
- Thu: Medium-long run or progression
- Fri: Quality #2 (tempo)
- Sat: Easy run with strides
- Sun: Long run

## Progressive Overload Principles

- **10% rule**: Increase weekly mileage by max 10% per week
- **Staircase progression**: 3 weeks up, 1 week down (repeat)
- **Long run cap**: No more than 30-35% of weekly mileage in one run
- **Quality cap**: No more than 20% of weekly volume at threshold or faster
- **New runner**: Start with 3 runs/week, add frequency before volume

## Workout Types by Phase

| Phase | Primary Workouts | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Base | Easy runs, long runs, strides | Aerobic base |
| Build | Tempo, cruise intervals, hills | Lactate threshold |
| Peak | Race-pace work, VO2max intervals | Race specificity |
| Taper | Short tempo, strides, easy volume | Maintain sharpness |

## Common Mistakes to Watch For
- Too much intensity too soon (should be <20% of volume)
- No recovery weeks (leads to staleness/injury)
- Long run too fast (should be conversational)
- Skipping base phase to jump to intensity
- Not respecting the taper (adding "just one more" hard session)
