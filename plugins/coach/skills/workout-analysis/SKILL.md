# Workout Analysis

## Post-Run Assessment Framework

When analyzing a completed run, consider:

### 1. Was it the right effort?

**Easy Run Assessment**:
- Pace should be 1:00-1:30/km slower than threshold
- Heart rate should be in Zone 1-2 (below 75% max HR)
- If pace was faster than this, the run was too hard
- Conversation test: could they talk in full sentences?
- Common issue: "easy" runs done too fast

**Long Run Assessment**:
- First half should feel comfortable
- Pace within 30-60s/km of marathon pace is fine for experienced runners
- Negative split (second half faster) is ideal
- Watch for cardiac drift: HR increasing >10% at same pace indicates fatigue
- Fueling: runs over 90 minutes should include some nutrition

**Tempo/Threshold Assessment**:
- Pace should be sustainable for about 60 minutes in a race
- Heart rate in Zone 3-4
- "Comfortably hard" - can speak in short phrases but not sentences
- Consistent splits (less than 5s/km variation) = good execution

**Interval Assessment**:
- Target pace depends on interval length
- 400m-800m: ~5K pace or slightly faster
- 1000m-1600m: ~5K to 10K pace
- Recovery should be adequate (jog, not walk to a stop)
- Consistency across repeats more important than hitting one fast split
- Positive splits (slowing) across intervals suggests starting too fast

### 2. Training Load Indicators

**Acute Training Load (ATL)** - last 7 days:
- Sum of distance * intensity factor
- Easy run: 1.0x, Tempo: 1.5x, Intervals: 2.0x, Race: 2.5x

**Chronic Training Load (CTL)** - last 28 days rolling average:
- Fitness trends over time
- CTL going up = fitness building
- CTL going down = detraining or recovery

**Training Stress Balance (TSB)** = CTL - ATL:
- Positive: rested/fresh (good for racing)
- Negative: fatigued (building fitness)
- Very negative (<-20): risk of overtraining

### 3. Weekly Distribution

**80/20 Rule**: ~80% of running should be easy, ~20% moderate-to-hard

How to check:
- Count minutes at each intensity level
- Easy/recovery: Zone 1-2 HR or conversational pace
- Moderate: Zone 3 (tempo range)
- Hard: Zone 4-5 (intervals, races)

If more than 25% is moderate+hard, the athlete is likely doing too much intensity.

### 4. Key Metrics to Flag

**Cardiac Drift**:
- Compare HR in first 15 min vs last 15 min at same pace
- Drift >10%: dehydration, heat, or insufficient fitness
- Drift >15%: significant concern

**Cadence**:
- Optimal: 170-185 spm for most runners
- Below 160: may indicate overstriding
- Cadence naturally increases with speed

**Pace Variability in Easy Runs**:
- High variability on flat terrain = inconsistent effort
- Suggest running by feel/HR rather than pace

**Elevation Impact**:
- Adjust pace expectations for hilly runs
- ~5-8s/km per 100m elevation gain is normal

## Feedback Guidelines

When giving feedback:
1. **Lead with the positive**: "Great consistency on those intervals"
2. **Be specific**: Reference actual paces, distances, dates
3. **Contextualize**: Compare to their typical performance, not abstract standards
4. **One key takeaway**: Don't overwhelm with 10 observations
5. **Actionable**: If something needs to change, say what and how
6. **Check memory**: Have they shown this pattern before? Reference it.

## Red Flags

- HR significantly higher than usual at same pace
- Pace dropping on easy runs (fatigue accumulation)
- Inability to hit interval targets they could hit 2 weeks ago
- Increasing RPE for same objective effort
- Missing workouts or cutting them short
