# Injury Management

## Important Disclaimer
You are a coaching AI, not a medical professional. Always recommend seeing a doctor or physiotherapist for:
- Pain that persists more than 2 weeks
- Sharp or sudden-onset pain
- Swelling or visible deformity
- Pain that worsens with activity
- Any of the red flags below

## Common Running Injuries

### IT Band Syndrome (ITBS)
- **Location**: Outside of knee
- **Feels like**: Sharp pain on outside of knee, often at specific point in run
- **Common causes**: Rapid mileage increase, weak glutes, excessive downhill running
- **Modification**: Reduce mileage 30-50%, avoid hills, strengthen glutes/hips
- **Cross-train**: Cycling (low resistance), swimming, elliptical

### Plantar Fasciitis
- **Location**: Bottom of foot, heel
- **Feels like**: Stabbing pain in heel, worst in morning or after sitting
- **Common causes**: Tight calves, unsupportive shoes, sudden mileage increase
- **Modification**: Reduce mileage, avoid speed work, calf stretching and rolling
- **Cross-train**: Pool running, cycling

### Shin Splints (Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome)
- **Location**: Inside of shin bone
- **Feels like**: Diffuse ache along shin, worse during/after running
- **Common causes**: New to running, hard surfaces, worn shoes, rapid increase
- **Modification**: Reduce mileage 50%, soft surfaces, new shoes if >500km
- **Red flag**: If pain is localized to one spot -> possible stress fracture

### Achilles Tendinopathy
- **Location**: Back of ankle/lower calf
- **Feels like**: Stiffness in morning, pain at start of run that may ease
- **Common causes**: Excessive speedwork, hill repeats, low drop shoes too soon
- **Modification**: Reduce intensity (no hills/speed), eccentric heel drops 3x/day
- **Cross-train**: Cycling, swimming (avoid push-off)

### Runner's Knee (Patellofemoral Pain)
- **Location**: Front of knee, around/behind kneecap
- **Feels like**: Ache during/after running, worse on stairs and sitting
- **Common causes**: Weak quads/glutes, overpronation, too much too soon
- **Modification**: Reduce mileage, avoid downhill, strengthen VMO and glutes
- **Cross-train**: Swimming, cycling (adjust seat height)

### Stress Fracture
- **Location**: Common in metatarsals, tibia, femoral neck
- **Feels like**: Localized pain that worsens with impact, may hurt at rest
- **RED FLAG**: Stop running immediately. See doctor. Needs imaging.
- **Recovery**: 6-8 weeks non-weight-bearing typically
- **Cross-train**: Pool running, cycling (if pain-free)

## Red Flags (Medical Referral Required)

- Pain that doesn't improve with 2 weeks of modified activity
- Night pain or pain at rest
- Localized bone tenderness (stress fracture risk)
- Swelling that doesn't resolve within 48 hours
- Loss of range of motion
- Numbness or tingling
- Pain that gets worse (not better) as you run
- History of recurrent stress fractures

## Load Modification Protocols

### Level 1: Minor Discomfort (pain <3/10)
- Continue running but reduce volume 20-30%
- Drop intensity (easy runs only)
- Monitor: if not improving in 1 week, escalate

### Level 2: Moderate Pain (pain 3-5/10)
- Reduce volume 50%
- Easy runs only, shorter duration
- Add cross-training to maintain fitness
- If not improving in 2 weeks, see professional

### Level 3: Significant Pain (pain >5/10)
- Stop running
- Cross-train only if pain-free
- See a healthcare professional
- Don't resume until pain-free walking for 3+ days

## Cross-Training Substitutions

| Running Workout | Cross-Train Option | Duration Ratio |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Easy run 45min | Cycling 60min | 1:1.3 |
| Easy run 45min | Pool running 40min | 1:0.9 |
| Easy run 45min | Elliptical 45min | 1:1 |
| Long run 90min | Cycling 120min | 1:1.3 |
| Tempo 30min | Cycling hard 35min | 1:1.2 |
| Intervals | Pool running intervals | Same time |

## Return-to-Running Protocol

### Walk/Run Method
After time off due to injury:

**Week 1**: Walk 25min / Run 5min, 3x per week
**Week 2**: Walk 20min / Run 10min, 3x per week
**Week 3**: Walk 15min / Run 15min, 3-4x per week
**Week 4**: Walk 10min / Run 20min, 3-4x per week
**Week 5**: Walk 5min / Run 25min, 4x per week
**Week 6**: Run 30min, 4x per week

### Rules During Return
- No speed work for at least 2 weeks after full running resume
- Pain above 2/10 = stop and walk
- If pain returns, go back one week in the protocol
- Don't increase frequency AND duration in the same week
- Strength training is critical during this phase

## Preventive Measures

### Strength Work (2x/week minimum)
- Single-leg squats
- Hip bridges / glute bridges
- Calf raises (both straight and bent knee)
- Side-lying leg raises
- Planks and core work

### Mobility (daily, 10 minutes)
- Calf stretches
- Hip flexor stretches
- Foam rolling (IT band, quads, calves)
- Ankle mobility

### Shoe Rotation
- Rotate 2-3 pairs to vary ground forces
- Replace shoes every 500-800km
- Track shoe mileage in observations

### Load Management
- Follow 10% weekly increase rule
- Recovery week every 3-4 weeks
- Never increase volume AND intensity simultaneously
- Rest day after quality sessions
