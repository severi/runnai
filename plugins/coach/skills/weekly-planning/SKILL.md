# Weekly Planning & Adaptation

## Core Principles

### Hard/Easy Alternation
- Never schedule two quality sessions on consecutive days
- Quality session = tempo, intervals, race-pace work, long run with quality elements
- Day after quality: easy run or rest
- Day after long run: rest or very easy short run

### Weekly Quality Budget
- **Beginner (< 30 km/week)**: 1 quality session + long run
- **Intermediate (30-60 km/week)**: 2 quality sessions + long run
- **Advanced (60+ km/week)**: 2-3 quality sessions + long run
- Long run counts as quality if it includes tempo or race-pace segments

### Volume Distribution
- No single run > 30-35% of weekly total
- Easy runs: 8-12km typically
- Recovery runs: 5-8km, genuinely slow

## Adapting the Plan

### Missed Workout Decision Tree

**Missed an easy run?**
-> Skip it. Don't add volume to other days. Weekly total will be slightly lower, that's fine.

**Missed a quality session?**
-> Can you do it tomorrow? If so, shift the week.
-> If >2 days late, skip it. Don't double up quality sessions.
-> Never do the missed quality AND the next scheduled quality on consecutive days.

**Missed the long run?**
-> Can you do it the next day? Swap with Monday's easy run.
-> If you miss the weekend entirely, do a medium-long run mid-week.
-> Don't add the missed long run distance to next week's long run.

**Missed multiple days (illness/travel)?**
-> 1-3 days missed: resume where you left off, skip missed workouts
-> 4-7 days missed: repeat the previous week at 80% volume
-> 7+ days missed: step back two weeks in the plan

### When to Add Extra Recovery

Add an extra rest day or convert quality to easy when:
- Resting heart rate is 5+ bpm above normal
- Sleep quality has been poor for 3+ nights
- Unusual muscle soreness lasting >48 hours
- Motivation is significantly lower than usual
- Life stress is elevated (work deadline, personal issues)
- Coming back from illness (even if feeling "fine")

### Fatigue Indicators
- **Physical**: heavy legs, elevated resting HR, poor sleep, appetite changes
- **Performance**: can't hit usual easy paces, interval targets feel impossible
- **Mental**: dread of running, irritability, loss of motivation
- **Injury signals**: new aches, old niggles returning

If 2+ indicators present: reduce next week's volume by 20-30%.
If 3+ indicators present: take an unplanned recovery week.

## Life Accommodations

### Travel
- Run in the morning before activities if possible
- Reduce planned volume by 20-30% during travel
- Substitute hotel gym (treadmill) for outdoor runs
- Running in a new city can be its own reward -- easy exploration runs
- Don't stress about missed runs during short trips (1-3 days)

### Illness
- **Above the neck** (cold, sniffles): Can attempt easy running, stop if it worsens
- **Below the neck** (cough, fever, body aches): Complete rest. No exceptions.
- **Return**: 1 day off for every day of illness, at easy intensity only
- **Fever**: No running until fever-free for 24 hours without medication

### Work Stress
- Training can be stress relief, but monitor total load
- Consider converting quality sessions to easy runs during peak stress
- Maintain frequency but reduce volume and intensity
- Sleep is more important than training during high-stress periods

### Weather Adjustments

**Heat (>25C)**:
- Slow pace by 10-30s/km
- Shift runs to early morning or evening
- Hydration becomes critical for runs >45 min
- Convert quality sessions to easy if heat index is extreme

**Cold (<-10C)**:
- Warm up indoors before heading out
- Reduce interval recovery time (keep moving)
- Treadmill is a valid alternative
- Watch for ice -- trail shoes or indoor alternatives

**Rain/Snow**:
- Light rain: generally fine, adjust footing awareness
- Heavy rain/storms: postpone or treadmill
- Post-rain: watch for slippery surfaces, especially leaves

## Pre-Race Week Modifications

### Week Before a Goal Race
- Volume at 50-60% of normal (marathon) or 70% (5K/10K)
- Last quality session: 3-4 days before race
- Include 2-3 race-pace strides in easy runs (just 4-6 x 20 seconds)
- No new foods, shoes, or gear
- Extra sleep: aim for 8+ hours, especially 2 nights before
- Light shakeout jog day before race (20-30 min easy)

### Week After a Goal Race
- At least 2-3 days complete rest
- Easy running only for 1-2 weeks
- No quality sessions for at least 1 week (5K/10K) or 3 weeks (marathon)
- Celebrate the achievement regardless of result
- Review race and update CONTEXT.md with new data points

## Weekly Check-In Template

When reviewing the week:
1. **Planned vs Actual**: Which workouts were completed? Modified? Missed?
2. **Volume**: Total km this week vs plan vs last 4-week average
3. **Quality**: Were quality sessions executed at target effort?
4. **Long Run**: Distance and quality -- did it go well?
5. **How they feel**: Energy, motivation, any aches?
6. **Looking ahead**: Any schedule conflicts or events next week?
7. **Adjustment**: Does next week's plan need modification?
