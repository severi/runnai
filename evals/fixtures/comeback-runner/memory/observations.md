# Observations

## 2025-12-15: Return to Running
Sara returned to running after patellofemoral syndrome forced a complete break in November 2025. October volume was dramatically reduced (only 4 runs) before the full stop. Physio cleared her for unrestricted running. Initial return pace ~6:28/km, noticeably slower than pre-injury ~6:06/km. Starting with easy runs only.

## 2026-01-10: Comeback Progress
Volume ramping up quickly — approaching 40-45km/week in January. Pace recovering back toward pre-injury levels (~6:08/km). Sara is doing fartleks again but no tempo or threshold work yet. Knee feels good but should monitor the rapid volume increase carefully. The jump from ~30km/week (Dec) to ~45km/week (Jan) is aggressive for someone returning from injury.

## 2026-01-25: Training Pattern
Sara runs 4-5 times/week with a consistent pattern: 2-3 easy runs, 1 fartlek, occasional long run. Cross-trains with cycling. Rest days Sunday and Tuesday. Doing knee-specific strength work 2x/week as recommended by physio.
